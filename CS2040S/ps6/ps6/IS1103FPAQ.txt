
When a bird gets into the house, meow madness ensues.
I hear objects shoved around and thud on the floor as the cats clamber up onto tables and other elevated surfaces to get within paw's reach of the bird.
The energizer-bunny kitties leap repeatedly as if bouncing on a trampoline, in a frenzied attempt to capture the bird.
They remind me of basketball players who jump up after a basketball tossed in the air during a jump ball.
The difference here is the "ball" has wings and stays aloft.
I suppose you could call it a jump-bird session. Maybe I should get basketball uniforms for the cats!
During these recent bird invasions, the first two birds did a terrible job of avoiding the cats.
Sunny caught the first one twice and Spot caught the second one. I think the poor birds panicked and flew too low.
They were probably scared, but thankfully not literally this time.
The third one wisely kept his cool and stayed out of reach.
Perhaps while at the water cooler, the bird bathe overheard rumors of their harrowing experiences, so he knew better than to freak out inside the house.
Getting a bird out of the house is an ordeal for both the bird and the humans. Mr Cool and another bird each flew out on their own as we encouraged each one into the direction of the catio waving upturned brooms.
I oh-so-carefully pried out the third bird that was firmly gripped in the mouth of one of the cats.
