0:00:11.680,0:00:15.920
dr judy michovitz has been called one of the 
most accomplished scientists of her generation

0:00:16.800,0:00:20.960
her 1991 doctoral thesis revolutionized 
the treatment of hiv aids

0:00:21.840,0:00:27.760
at the height of her career dr michovitz published 
a blockbuster article in the journal science the

0:00:27.760,0:00:31.920
controversial article sent shockwaves through 
the scientific community as it revealed that the

0:00:31.920,0:00:37.040
common use of animal and human fetal tissues were 
unleashing devastating plagues of chronic diseases

0:00:37.760,0:00:43.200
for exposing their deadly secrets the minions of 
big pharma waged war on dr michael vitz destroying

0:00:43.200,0:00:51.440
her good name career and personal life now as the 
fate of nations hang in the balance dr michovitz

0:00:51.440,0:00:56.080
is naming names of those behind the plague of 
corruption that places all human life in danger

0:00:57.840,0:01:01.600
you made a discovery that conflicted 
with the agreed-upon narrative

0:01:02.240,0:01:08.240
correct and for that they did everything in 
their powers to destroy your life correct

0:01:08.240,0:01:14.880
you were arrested correct and then you were put 
under a gag order for for five years if i went

0:01:14.880,0:01:22.800
on social media if i said anything at all they 
would find new evidence and um and put me back

0:01:22.800,0:01:29.280
in jail and it was one of the few times i cried 
and it was because i knew there was no evidence

0:01:29.280,0:01:36.000
the first time and they when you can unleash that 
kind of force to force someone into bankruptcy

0:01:36.000,0:01:43.360
with a perfect credit score and so that i 
couldn't bring my 97 witnesses which included

0:01:43.360,0:01:50.960
the heads tony fauci you know ian lipkin the heads 
of the public health in hhs who would have had to

0:01:50.960,0:01:57.040
testify that we did absolutely nothing wrong 
and so what did they charge you with nothing

0:01:57.760,0:02:03.120
but you're in jail i was held in jail with no 
charges i was called a fugitive from justice

0:02:07.520,0:02:14.000
no warrant literally drug me out of the house our 
neighbors are looking at what's going on here you

0:02:14.000,0:02:19.200
know they search my house without a warrant 
literally terrorized my husband for five days

0:02:19.760,0:02:25.600
they said if you don't find the notebooks 
if you don't find the material which was

0:02:25.600,0:02:31.840
not in my possession but planted in my house as if 
you took intellectual property from the laboratory

0:02:31.840,0:02:38.480
is that correct it was it was intended to appear 
as if i took confidential material names and

0:02:38.480,0:02:44.240
intellectual property from the laboratory 
and i could prove beyond a shadow of a doubt

0:02:44.240,0:02:52.000
that i didn't heads of our entire hhs 
colluded and destroyed my reputation

0:02:52.000,0:02:58.160
and the department of justice and the fbi sat 
on it and kept that case under seal which means

0:02:58.160,0:03:04.000
you can't say there's a case or your lawyers are 
held in contempt of court so you can't even get

0:03:04.000,0:03:11.200
a lawyer to defend you so every single due 
process right was taken away from me and

0:03:11.200,0:03:15.760
to this day remains the same i have 
no constitutional freedoms or rights

0:03:15.760,0:03:21.200
yet you sit here i think a lot of people would 
probably have just taken the retirement out early

0:03:22.000,0:03:30.240
laid low but you have decided to come forth when 
your gag order has been released to write a book

0:03:30.240,0:03:36.080
called plague of corruption restoring faith in 
the promise of science and you are naming names

0:03:36.640,0:03:44.640
absolutely apparently their attempt to silence you 
has failed and i i have to ask how do you sit here

0:03:44.640,0:03:51.760
with confidence to call out these great forces and 
not fear for your life as you leave this building

0:03:51.760,0:03:57.600
because if we don't stop this now we can not 
only forget our republic and our freedom but

0:03:57.600,0:04:04.720
we can forget humanity because we'll be killed 
by this agenda so anthony fauci my name is uh

0:04:04.720,0:04:10.560
dr tony fauci i'm the director the man who is 
heading the pandemic task force was involved

0:04:10.560,0:04:18.720
in a cover-up he directed the cover-up and in 
fact everybody else was paid off and paid off

0:04:18.720,0:04:26.320
big time millions of dollars in funding from tony 
fauci tony fauci's organization national institute

0:04:26.320,0:04:32.400
of allergy infectious disease these investigators 
that committed the fraud continue to this day to

0:04:32.400,0:04:39.280
be paid big time by the nia id and the whole world 
is listening to his advice for how to handle this

0:04:39.280,0:04:44.000
current pandemic how do we know that what he's 
saying is what we need to be learning what he's

0:04:44.000,0:04:51.600
saying is absolute uh propaganda and and the 
same kind of propaganda that he's perpetrated

0:04:51.600,0:04:58.640
to kill millions since 1984. we know from this 
study quite clearly that there will be a delay

0:04:58.640,0:05:04.160
in progression significantly greater than for 
individuals who do not take the drug it started

0:05:04.160,0:05:12.400
really when i was 25 years old i was part of 
the team that isolated hiv from the saliva

0:05:12.400,0:05:23.840
and blood of the patients from france where luke 
montgomery had originally isolated the virus

0:05:24.720,0:05:31.920
this was a confirmatory study but tony fauci 
and robert gallo were working together then to

0:05:31.920,0:05:39.360
spin the story in a different way at that time dr 
rossetti was out of town and tony fauci says you

0:05:39.360,0:05:47.280
know we understand that you have a paper in press 
and we want a copy of it and i said yes there's

0:05:47.280,0:05:53.840
a paper and press and it's confidential 
and no i will not give you a copy of it

0:05:53.840,0:05:59.760
he started screaming at me then he said give us 
the paper right now or or you'll be fired for

0:05:59.760,0:06:06.160
insubordination and i just said i'm sure when dr 
recetti gets back you can have the conversation

0:06:06.160,0:06:12.400
and so frank comes back you know several weeks 
later and is really bullied into giving fauci

0:06:12.400,0:06:19.680
the paper fauchi holds up the publication of the 
paper for several months while robert gallo writes

0:06:19.680,0:06:26.160
his own paper and takes all the credit and of 
course patents are involved this delay of the

0:06:26.160,0:06:33.840
confirmation you know literally led to spreading 
the virus around um you know killing millions

0:06:36.000,0:06:42.560
perhaps no one expressed the anguish of aids 
better than new york writer larry kramer

0:06:45.680,0:06:50.880
but he was even more angry at the federal 
government and the pharmaceutical industry

0:06:50.880,0:06:56.080
one person who felt cramer's 
fury was nih dr anthony fauci

0:06:58.800,0:07:06.320
it's still been crushing to me to think that i 
didn't know my work in 1999 was something that

0:07:06.320,0:07:15.600
had been avoided from 83 and 82 when the virus was 
isolated the virus didn't have to wait until 84 to

0:07:15.600,0:07:24.080
be confirmed think of how many people the entire 
continent of africa you know lost the generation

0:07:24.080,0:07:30.640
as that virus was spread through because of the 
arrogance of a group of people and it includes

0:07:30.640,0:07:36.960
robert redfield who's now the head of the cdc 
right along with tony fauci they were working

0:07:36.960,0:07:43.200
together to take credit and make money and 
they had the patents on it and tailored them

0:07:43.200,0:07:50.560
to il2 therapy which was absolutely the 
wrong therapy and had that not happened

0:07:50.560,0:07:58.080
millions wouldn't have died from hiv how can a man 
who's giving any any person who's giving global

0:07:58.080,0:08:03.200
advice for health own a patent in the solution in 
the vaccine isn't that a conflict of interest or

0:08:03.200,0:08:09.280
shouldn't it be it is a conflict of interest and 
in fact this is one of the things that i i've been

0:08:09.280,0:08:16.640
saying and would like to say to president trump 
repeal the buy dole act buy gold fundamentally

0:08:16.640,0:08:20.720
changed the way universities approach technology 
transfer and you can see that best in the

0:08:20.720,0:08:27.520
statistics universities obtained 16 times as many 
patents today as they did in 1980. now everybody's

0:08:27.520,0:08:32.240
getting more patents but still university's 
share of all patents in the united states is

0:08:32.240,0:08:38.160
more than five times greater than it was before 
baidul the situation has gotten so bad that one

0:08:39.520,0:08:44.400
information technology industry official has 
publicly referred to universities as quote

0:08:44.400,0:08:50.720
crack addicts unquote driven by quote small-minded 
tech transfer offices addicted to patent royalties

0:08:51.440,0:08:58.560
that act gave government workers the 
right to patent their discoveries so to

0:08:58.560,0:09:05.680
to claim intellectual property for 
discoveries that the taxpayer paid for

0:09:06.240,0:09:13.280
ever since that happened in the early 80s it 
destroyed science and this allowed the development

0:09:13.280,0:09:19.920
of those conflicts of interest and this is the 
crime behind letting somebody like bill gates

0:09:19.920,0:09:25.920
with billions of dollars nobody elected him he 
has no medical background he has no expertise

0:09:25.920,0:09:31.120
but we let people like that have a voice in this 
country while we destroy the lives of millions of

0:09:31.120,0:09:40.640
people normalcy only returns when we've largely 
vaccinated the entire global population if we

0:09:40.640,0:09:46.080
activate mandatory vaccines globally i imagine 
these people stand to make hundreds of billions

0:09:46.080,0:09:52.000
of dollars that own the vaccines and they'll kill 
millions as they already have with their vaccines

0:09:52.000,0:10:00.240
there is no vaccine currently on the schedule 
for any rna virus that works so i have to ask

0:10:00.240,0:10:07.040
you are you anti-vaccine oh absolutely 
not i'm in fact vaccine is immune therapy

0:10:07.680,0:10:15.040
just like interferon alpha is immune therapy so 
i'm not anti-vaccine my job is to develop immune

0:10:15.040,0:10:20.320
therapies that's what vaccines are do you believe 
that this virus was created in a laboratory

0:10:21.120,0:10:28.080
i wouldn't use the word created but you 
can't say naturally occurring if it was

0:10:28.960,0:10:37.360
by way of the laboratory so it's very clear this 
virus was manipulated these this family of viruses

0:10:37.360,0:10:44.240
was manipulated and studied in a laboratory 
where the animals were taken into the laboratory

0:10:44.240,0:10:51.600
and this is what was released whether deliberate 
or not that cannot be naturally occurring

0:10:51.600,0:10:57.760
somebody didn't go to a market get a bat the 
virus didn't jump directly to humans that's not

0:10:57.760,0:11:04.720
how it works that's accelerated viral evolution 
if it was a natural occurrence it would take it

0:11:05.440,0:11:12.800
up to 800 years to occur this occurred from 
sars one within a decade that's not that's not

0:11:12.800,0:11:18.240
naturally occurring and do you have any ideas of 
where this occurred oh yeah i'm sure it occurred

0:11:18.240,0:11:24.000
between the north carolina laboratories fort 
dietrich us army research institute of infectious

0:11:24.000,0:11:30.480
disease and the woohound laboratory 3.7 million 
dollars flowed from the national institutes of

0:11:30.480,0:11:37.760
health here in the u.s to the wuhan lab in china 
the same lab where many people have said that this

0:11:37.760,0:11:44.800
coronavirus infection first originated we also 
now know that ni aid the department associated

0:11:44.800,0:11:50.240
with the national institutes of health of which 
dr anthony fauci is in control had already been

0:11:50.240,0:11:58.640
conducting experiments with the wuhan lab in the 
past in regard to coronavirus if dr anthony fauci

0:11:58.640,0:12:04.080
cannot be honest with the public about his 
connection to this lab then fauci has to go

0:12:05.040,0:12:13.760
in 1999 i was working in fort dietrich in 
usamrid there and my job was to teach ebola

0:12:13.760,0:12:21.040
how to infect human cells without killing them 
ebola couldn't infect human cells until we took

0:12:21.040,0:12:26.960
it in the laboratories and taught talking it's 
hard to ignore the death tolls people have been

0:12:26.960,0:12:32.400
dying they are dying from this in in quite 
alarming numbers how do you reconcile that

0:12:34.080,0:12:42.160
it's pretty easy when you see for me when you see 
what the government has done and that is that they

0:12:42.160,0:12:50.960
took quoting dr burks we've taken a very liberal 
approach to mortality if my husband were to die

0:12:51.600,0:12:58.720
who has copd his lungs have fibrosis his 
lungs would look exactly like somebody with

0:12:58.720,0:13:06.480
covid 19 theoretically but he has no evidence of 
infection so if you're not testing and you don't

0:13:06.480,0:13:13.120
have evidence of infection and if you walked in 
there today you know they'd call it covid19 and

0:13:13.120,0:13:19.280
and we hear this from the doctors and nurses who 
are upset i've seen so many doctors online that

0:13:19.280,0:13:26.000
have made their own webcam videos just perplexed 
by the protocol that the cdc had given them well

0:13:26.000,0:13:32.560
last friday i received a seven page document 
that sort of told me that if i had an 86 year

0:13:32.560,0:13:39.120
old patient that had pneumonia but was never 
tested for covid19 but sometime after she came

0:13:39.120,0:13:44.880
down with pneumonia we learned that she had been 
exposed to her son who had no symptoms but later

0:13:44.880,0:13:50.640
on was identified with covet 19 that it would be 
appropriate to diagnose on the death certificate

0:13:50.640,0:13:56.400
coven 19. when i'm writing up my death report 
i'm being pressured to add covet why is that

0:13:57.520,0:14:02.240
why are we being pressured to add covet to maybe 
increase the numbers and make it look a little

0:14:02.240,0:14:07.760
bit worse than it is i think so why would they 
want to skew the number of deaths due to kova 19

0:14:10.080,0:14:16.800
well fear is a great way to control people 
and sometimes people's ability to think for

0:14:16.800,0:14:21.840
themselves is paralyzed if they're frightened 
enough and that's not where i want people to be

0:14:21.840,0:14:26.560
i want people to say we're going to get through 
this i'm going to use my head i'm going to go to

0:14:26.560,0:14:31.440
different sources i'm going to listen to different 
sources and i'm going to think for myself because

0:14:31.440,0:14:36.960
that's what america is about if someone 
dies with covid19 we are counting that

0:14:37.680,0:14:43.840
as a copin 19 death you don't die with 
an infection you die from an infection

0:14:44.720,0:14:50.880
i've talked with doctors who have admitted that 
they are being incentivized to list patients

0:14:50.880,0:14:59.600
that are sick or have died with cobit 19. yeah 
13 000 for medicare if you call it coven 19.

0:14:59.600,0:15:04.880
right now medicare's determined that if you have 
a coven 19 admission to the hospital you'll get

0:15:04.880,0:15:13.120
paid 13 000 if that coven 19 patient goes on a 
ventilator you get 39 dollars three times as much

0:15:13.120,0:15:17.280
and you've killed them with the ventilator because 
you gave them the wrong treatment all the things

0:15:17.280,0:15:22.640
that just don't make sense the patients i'm seeing 
in front of me the lungs i'm trying to improve

0:15:22.640,0:15:27.920
have led me to believe that we are operating under 
a medical paradigm that is untrue and i fear that

0:15:27.920,0:15:32.720
this misguided treatment will lead to a tremendous 
amount of harm to a great number of people in a

0:15:32.720,0:15:39.680
very short time my next question is about italy i 
want to know why italy was hit so hard italy has

0:15:39.680,0:15:47.760
a very old population um they're very sick with 
inflammatory disorders they got at the beginning

0:15:47.760,0:15:59.360
of 2019 an untested new form of influenza vaccine 
that had four different strains of influenza

0:15:59.360,0:16:08.960
including the highly pathogenic h1n1 that vaccine 
was grown in a cell line a dog cell line dogs have

0:16:08.960,0:16:14.960
lots of coronaviruses and that's why they're not 
testing there you could just say oh it was that as

0:16:14.960,0:16:19.840
the country begins emerging from the worst of 
the coronavirus epidemic one question remains

0:16:19.840,0:16:26.320
what happened to all the hydroxychloroquine we 
know that hydrochloroquine and zinc are working

0:16:26.320,0:16:31.200
great for patients and then fauci comes out and 
says well there's no double blind control placebo

0:16:31.200,0:16:37.360
study which by the way dr fauci is there going to 
be a double blind control placebo study of your

0:16:37.360,0:16:44.480
vaccine is there in a survey polling nearly 2300 
doctors in some 30 countries hydroxychloroquine

0:16:44.480,0:16:50.080
was ranked as the most effective medication 
to treat the virus the ama was saying you

0:16:50.080,0:16:56.080
know doctors will lose their license if they use 
hydroxychloroquine the anti-malarial drug that's

0:16:56.080,0:17:04.160
been on the list of essential medicine worldwide 
for 70 years dr fauci calls that anecdotal data

0:17:04.160,0:17:10.640
it's not storytelling if we have thousands of 
pages of data saying it's effective against these

0:17:10.640,0:17:17.120
families of viruses this is essential medicine 
and they keep it from the people not only now but

0:17:17.120,0:17:24.000
back in autism with our discovery there was an old 
antiviral drug hundred-year-old drug called sermon

0:17:24.000,0:17:31.200
on the w.h.o list of essential medicine it 
literally gave kids with autism a voice a life

0:17:31.200,0:17:36.000
what did bayer and monsanto do they took it away 
from everybody you couldn't get it to save your

0:17:36.000,0:17:41.840
life right now we tried believe me every way we 
could so when you take away a medicine and not

0:17:41.840,0:17:50.160
just the who not just the who the fda the cdc 
tony fauci close everything just end it all and

0:17:50.160,0:17:54.960
we've got a healthy world again and we got tons of 
money because we can take all that money they're

0:17:54.960,0:18:00.640
making on their patents and we can give it to the 
victims of this plague of corruption is it safe to

0:18:00.640,0:18:06.080
say that anything that cannot be patented has been 
shut down intentionally because there's no way to

0:18:06.080,0:18:11.920
profit from it all these natural remedies that we 
have had for ever absolutely that's fair to say

0:18:11.920,0:18:20.560
and that's exactly what's going on in cobit 19. 
the game is to prevent the therapies till everyone

0:18:20.560,0:18:30.240
is infected and push the vaccines knowing that 
the flu vaccines increase the odds by 36 percent

0:18:30.240,0:18:37.280
of getting covered 19. where does that data come 
from a publication last year where the military

0:18:37.280,0:18:44.640
who had been vaccinated with influenza were more 
susceptible to coronaviruses coronaviruses are in

0:18:44.640,0:18:52.480
every animal so if you've ever had a flu vaccine 
you were injected with coronaviruses and then to

0:18:52.480,0:18:58.240
put on a mask this doesn't make any sense we wear 
a mask in an acute setting to protect us we're not

0:18:58.240,0:19:05.360
wearing masks why is that because we understand 
microbiology we understand immunology and we

0:19:05.360,0:19:11.280
want strong immune systems our immune system is 
used to touching we share bacteria staphylococcal

0:19:11.280,0:19:16.720
streptococcal bacteria viruses we develop an 
immune response daily to this stuff when you

0:19:16.720,0:19:23.760
take that away from me my immune system drops as 
i shelter in place my immune system drops you keep

0:19:23.760,0:19:28.800
me there for months it drops more and now i'm at 
home hand washing vigorously washing the counters

0:19:29.920,0:19:35.280
worried about things that are indeed what i need 
to survive you know you're not immunodeficient and

0:19:35.280,0:19:40.800
you're not elderly you should be able to go out 
without any gloves and without a mask i think if

0:19:40.800,0:19:45.600
you are those things you should either set shelter 
in place or wear a mask and gloves i don't think

0:19:45.600,0:19:51.520
everybody needs to wear masking gloves because 
it reduces your bacterial flora it doesn't allow

0:19:51.520,0:19:56.880
you to interact with society and your bacteria 
flora and your viruses your friends that protect

0:19:56.880,0:20:02.640
you from other diseases end up going away and now 
you're more likely to get opportunistic infections

0:20:02.640,0:20:07.680
infections that are hoping you don't have your 
good bugs fighting for you if that makes sense and

0:20:07.680,0:20:11.760
then as we all come out of shelter in place with 
a lower immune system and start trading viruses

0:20:11.760,0:20:16.480
bacteria what do you think is going to happen 
disease is going to spike i guarantee when we

0:20:16.480,0:20:22.960
reopen there's going to be a huge huge amount of 
illness that's going to be rampant the building

0:20:22.960,0:20:29.600
blocks of your immune system is virus and bacteria 
end of story wearing the mask literally activates

0:20:29.600,0:20:36.400
your own virus you're getting sick from your own 
reactivated coronavirus expressions and if it

0:20:36.400,0:20:43.440
happens to be sars cove too then you've got a big 
problem you're you're not the first virologist who

0:20:43.440,0:20:48.800
has told me that we're doing the exact opposite of 
what we should be doing to contain and to create

0:20:48.800,0:20:56.240
immunity from this virus why would you close the 
beach you've got sequences in the soil in the sand

0:20:56.240,0:21:02.480
you've got healing microbes in the 
ocean in the salt water that's insanity

0:21:11.680,0:21:14.800
these institutions that are polluting our

0:21:14.800,0:21:19.280
environment and our bodies there was a time when 
they actually had to fight their own battles

0:21:20.000,0:21:27.120
but they've done such a great job at manipulating 
the masses that it's other people shutting down

0:21:27.120,0:21:31.680
other citizens and the big tech platforms 
follow suit and they shut everything down

0:21:32.400,0:21:38.880
there is no dissenting voices allowed anymore 
in this free country which is something i never

0:21:38.880,0:21:44.480
thought i would live to see nor would i 
accept what i've experienced since 2011.

0:21:45.360,0:21:54.160
it's beyond comprehension how a society can be so 
fooled that the types of propaganda continue to

0:21:54.160,0:21:59.920
where they're just driving us to hate each other 
you want to go to work yes you get this disease

0:21:59.920,0:22:05.040
i think the medical profession know what the 
they've been wrong so far ma'am they've been wrong

0:22:06.320,0:22:12.480
hopefully this is the wake up call of all 
america to realize this makes no sense

0:22:12.480,0:22:18.320
and and we win because it will take down the 
whole program with information like this and

0:22:18.320,0:22:23.200
and for me it's the great news that the 
doctors are waking up and saying wait a minute

0:22:23.200,0:22:26.720
you you doctors that are watching 
this and i see a lot of you right here

0:22:26.720,0:22:31.600
why are you not getting loud i'm here to defend 
you i'm here to defend my freedoms i'm here

0:22:31.600,0:22:36.000
to defend my family's freedoms my patience 
rights to choose what to do with their life

0:22:37.920,0:22:43.040
i'm just blown away and i'm blown away 
why there are not more doctors like me

0:22:43.040,0:22:48.640
talking about this all over the place we should 
be banding together right now you need to wake up

0:22:48.640,0:22:52.640
because your liberties are getting taken away 
from you all because of fake news that's out

0:22:52.640,0:22:58.160
there this is wrong people should be going to 
jail for this stuff so it's not the scientists

0:22:58.160,0:23:05.840
who are in any way dishonest they're listening to 
people who for more than 40 years have controlled

0:23:05.840,0:23:12.160
who gets funded what gets published and i'm sorry 
to say many many people will simply take the

0:23:12.160,0:23:19.200
money and the fame and that support things that 
absolutely aren't true what do you say to the

0:23:19.200,0:23:24.800
medical professionals that are just beginning 
to get a glimpse of the depth to which they

0:23:24.800,0:23:31.280
have been misled and steered away from their 
oath to do no harm i say forgive yourselves

0:23:32.400,0:23:41.120
it it's the hardest thing to realize for all of 
us and is is that with all the best intention we

0:23:41.120,0:23:49.120
studied we learned what we thought was the truth 
we had no idea that that the the data that we were

0:23:49.120,0:23:57.840
being told was true was not true we've been taught 
now in our in our schools a very different science

0:23:57.840,0:24:04.320
you don't get funded if you don't speak the 
party line you don't get published that was

0:24:04.320,0:24:11.040
probably the hardest thing for me to take is 
understanding that scientific journals would

0:24:11.040,0:24:16.320
would twist the discovery that should have healed 
all will the scientific community have the courage

0:24:16.320,0:24:22.400
to answer the question of whether these diseases 
might have been of their own creation thank you

0:24:23.840,0:24:30.320
so what we did pretty much ever since i got 
out of jail we started an education company

0:24:30.320,0:24:34.240
we wake up doctors and it's very difficult

0:24:34.240,0:24:40.640
but every doctor who realized they may have 
been part of the problem has now turned that

0:24:40.640,0:24:46.240
around to march toward a better society and 
restore faith in the promise of medicine

0:24:49.040,0:24:50.080
that's all we can do

0:24:54.880,0:24:58.560
well dr michael vitz thank you so much for 
your time it's been a real honor to sit here

0:24:58.560,0:25:03.200
with you and and particularly thank you for your 
courage thank you mickey i appreciate it a lot

0:25:04.880,0:25:11.040
the idea that we are now a few days away from 
a new administration given as you heard from

0:25:11.040,0:25:15.840
the introduction that i have been around for a 
while and have had the opportunity of serving

0:25:15.840,0:25:21.520
in five administrations i thought i would 
bring that perspective to the topic today

0:25:21.520,0:25:29.280
is the issue of pandemic uh preparedness and 
if there's one message that i want to leave

0:25:29.280,0:25:34.800
with you today is that there is no question 
that there will be a surprise outbreak

0:25:37.040,0:25:40.000
the thing we're extraordinarily confident about is

0:25:40.000,0:25:52.000
that we are going to see this 
in the next few years thank you
